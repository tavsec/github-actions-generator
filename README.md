# github-actions-generator
This application was developed as a part of [GitHub + Dev hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-dev-2023-hackathon-4ocn). The main purpose of this app is to help developers create GitHub Actions files from a simple form, and also provide them with the instructions on how to set up their CICD process.

## Setup
To run this application you need to have NPM and NodeJs installed. Once you have it, simply run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. This will set up your local server.
